## Overview
#### Problem:
Do you ever find unnecesary spam emails in your primary inbox or worse have to go looking for a ham email in your spam/junk folders?

#### Description:
The aim of this project is to create a classification model that can accurately sort whether an email is spam or ham. 
> Spam: unsolicited and unwanted junk email sent out in bulk to an indiscriminate

> Ham: non-spam email, “good/wanted” email

## Repository Structure:
In this repository, you will find the cleaning.ipynb file where we cleaned our data, ran our models, and made changes to optimize them. You will also find a Resources folder that contains the main_ham folder and the main_spam folder with the raw data (retrieved from Kaggle).
